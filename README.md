# MCMC-potential
I used an MCMC Metropolis search to hunt for molecule shapes from initial random throws of the system's electrons and protons. The result: promising approximations across many geometries, a lot of hard-won learning, and a clear path for improving a fast, non-quantum approach to molecular geometry prediction.
